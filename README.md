# Obstacle-Avoiding-Car-Robot-Arduino
This is a project I made in grade 9 for my Computer Science Exhibition. I received immense appreciation for the aesthetics and practicalities of my model. This was made on Arduino with the help of Arduino board, and mainly ultrasonic sensors which helped detect obstacles. 
The car was self-driven, it would detect obstacles that would come on it's path and then look for a spot with no obstacle, turn in that direction, and continue moving forward. It needed fair amount of power to run. I haven added comments to the code, it is pretty much self-explanatory.
Thank you.
