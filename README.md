# Obstacle-Avoiding-Car-Robot-Arduino
This is a project I made in grade 9 for my Computer Science Exhibition. I received immense appreciation for the aesthetics and practicalities of my model. This was made on Arduino with the help of Arduino board, and mainly ultrasonic sensors which helped detect obstacles.
